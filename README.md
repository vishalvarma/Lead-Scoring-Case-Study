# Problem Statement

 X Education is an online education company catering to industry professionals, where interested individuals frequently visit the website to browse courses. Upon filling out a form, these individuals are categorized as leads. Subsequently, the sales team engages in outreach efforts, such as calls and emails, to convert leads into customers. While some leads convert, the majority do not, resulting in a typical lead conversion rate of around 30%. To improve efficiency, the company aims to identify the most promising leads, referred to as Hot Leads. By focusing efforts on this select group, the company anticipates a higher lead conversion rate compared to engaging with all leads indiscriminately.

# Business Objective

Lead X has requested the development of a model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead, facilitating the identification of Hot Leads and improving conversion rates. The CEO aims to achieve a lead conversion rate of 80%, emphasizing the importance of the model's predictive accuracy. Furthermore, Lead X seeks a model capable of accommodating future constraints, such as peak time actions, manpower utilization strategies, and post-target achievement approaches, to ensure sustained success in lead conversion efforts.
